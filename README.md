## 👋 About Me

I am an Economist and Master’s candidate in Economics at PIMES/UFPE, with a strong focus on applied macroeconomics, econometrics, public finance, and machine learning.

- Public budget management and financial execution  
- Statistical monitoring of operational aviation data 
- Data organization and reporting to support decision-making  

During my Master's program, I have developed training in:

- Macroeconomic theory and applied macroeconomics
